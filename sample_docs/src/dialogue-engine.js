    text: "Personal record. 2351-09-12. My 35th birthday was four days ago. I did not celebrate because I spent the day in the apex chamber. Today is different. The entity has been in its usual position for 7 days — immobile, facing away from the observation window, emitting the 0.8847 Hz resonance that they all emit. At 14:22 KST today, it turned. Faced the window directly. It did not attack. I have never seen a VE-Type IV demonstrate that level of directed attention toward a human observer. It resonated at 0.8847. Then at 0.8847 again but with an overtone I have not catalogued. Then it turned away. I do not know what this means. I know what I hope it means. I know that I have 36 more years if my genetics are average and I intend to use every one of them. — C. Rhae.",
